# Vite and TS Practice - Dave Gray TS Course (Lessons 10 & 11)

- Vite is a local development server written by Evan You, the creator of Vue.js, and used by default by Vue and for React project templates. It has support for TypeScript and JSX. It uses Rollup and esbuild internally for bundling.

### Init Project

- Need to install Node in order to use Vite (npm)

1. npm create vite@latest
2. Name project, select framework (vanilla, React, etc.), select variant (JS/TS)
3. npm install
4. npm run dev

- vite-env.d.ts : this is where we set types for env variables (see Vite docs for how to handle env vars)
